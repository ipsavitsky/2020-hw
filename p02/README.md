# Graphs

This task consists of 3 files:

1. graphs.h - a header for graphs.c file. REFER TO THIS FILE in case you need additional documentation. This file is also documented in doxygen(dox_conf is the config)
2. graphs.c - implementation of graphs.h
3. main.c - whatever you want to do with the graph

Note that some functions are meant to be launched in a specific manner(waycount(), for example). It WOULD be easier to write functions to properly launch such functions, but for now I reserved to writing special warnings.

This repo also has a simple makefile which utilises clang as the default compiler
