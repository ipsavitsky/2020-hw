This task consists of 3 files\+:


\begin{DoxyEnumerate}
\item \mbox{\hyperlink{graphs_8h}{graphs.\+h}} -\/ a header for \mbox{\hyperlink{graphs_8c}{graphs.\+c}} file. R\+E\+F\+ER TO T\+H\+IS F\+I\+LE in case you need additional documentation. This file is also documented in doxygen(dox\+\_\+conf is the config)
\item \mbox{\hyperlink{graphs_8c}{graphs.\+c}} -\/ implementation of \mbox{\hyperlink{graphs_8h}{graphs.\+h}}
\item main.\+c -\/ whatever you want to do with the graph
\end{DoxyEnumerate}

This repo also has a simple makefile which utilises clang as the default compiler
